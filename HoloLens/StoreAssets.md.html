# StoreAssets

Assets which originate from the Unity Store or other locations (imported packages and so on) are not to be added to the git repository. Therefore that directory is present in the `.gitignore`. When pulling from the repo, those assets must be added manually from the store or the original URL.

## Obligatory Assets
